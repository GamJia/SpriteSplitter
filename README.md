# SpriteSplitter

A Cocos Creator extension that automatically generates a `.plist` file from a sprite sheet, defining individual sprite frames based on two modes:

- **Grid By Cell Size**: Define the width and height of each sprite frame in pixels within the sheet.
- **Grid By Cell Count**: Define how many columns and rows to divide the sprite sheet into.

This is the **first official release** of SpriteSplitter with automatic `.plist` generation!
